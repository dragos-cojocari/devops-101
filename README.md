# devops-101

Practice basic devops

## Setup the repository

1. Install [Precommit](https://pre-commit.com/)
2. Configure your git client to [sign the commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
3. Contribute changes via PRs

Note: all commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This is verified in the pre-commit and enforced in the GitHub Action.
